Privacy Policy
Introduction

Welcome to PlateMeister.
You can have fun finding out about car license plates. In many countries you have different license plates by area, state, county, etc. For instance, in Germany B in the beginning means Berlin. In France 75 in the right blue strip means Paris and in the Czech Republic, A as the second letter means Prague.


Our privacy policy will help you understand what information we collect at Platemeister, how Platemeister uses it, and what choices you have. Platemeister built the Platemeister app as a free app. This SERVICE is provided by Platemeister at no cost and is intended for use as is. 

The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions, which is accessible in our website, unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy.

This app for now is completely free. It has no ads, costs no money and collects no information about you (outside of your phone, of course - but nothing is transferred anywhere outside).


Information Collection and Use


Location Information


The app records your precise location.
It is used in order to see license plates in your area, to see a map with all the license paltes and where they were recorded - and when you record a license plate as 'seen', it keeps your location where you saw it.
The location is kept ONLY within the app. I do not store it anywhere in the cloud. I do not collect any extenal statistics of users and locations and do not send your location to any server.
It could be that external services, such as the map or the module that converts geographical coordinates to address collects some information, but they have nothing to do with me. 



Childrenâ€™s Privacy
This Services is for educational purpose only. You can use it with kids for educational and fun purposes. For instance, it is a common thing to make a quiz while driving of what license plates are seen and where they are from. Of course, the driver may NOT use the app while driving.


Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately, after they are posted on this page.
